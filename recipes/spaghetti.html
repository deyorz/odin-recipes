        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook Pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Cook Pancetta: In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta and cook until crispy. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for an additional minute.</li>
            <li>Prepare Sauce: In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.</li>
            <li>Combine: Add the hot, drained spaghetti to the skillet with the pancetta and garlic. Remove from heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, stirring vigorously to create a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water.</li>
            <li>Season: Season with salt and plenty of black pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve: Garnish with freshly chopped parsley, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
